#  Control of Arbitrary Waveform Generators with PyVISA and SCPI command set. This started as

#  has been made more generic to be used with other Siglent AWGs.
#  The hope is that these commands in this package are generic enough to be
#  used with other brands but may need to make this an Siglent specific
#  package in the future if find that not to be true.
